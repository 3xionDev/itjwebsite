      <p class="descriptionText"> Computer Engineering is a career that integrates both electronic and software engineering. It involves designing hardware for computers and writing programs for that hardware. Typically, it requires an education in software engineering, electronic engineering, computer science, and software design. These courses can be found in many tech-based universities such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) and Stevens University. Typically, a Computer Engineer is responsible for designing computer hardware such as motherboards or CPUs and then subsequently writing firmware for this hardware. Computer Engineering positions are offered at many companies and organizations, with the highest demand being within the larger organizations such as the US Government and Berkeley National Laboratory. The average income for a Computer Engineer is around $83,600, however salaries can extend up to $148,563 per year for high-level engineers at large companies. </p>
